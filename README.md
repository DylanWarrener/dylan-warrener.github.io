Dylan Warrener ‚Ä¢ Software Developer Portfolio
Welcome! This repository hosts my personal portfolio website, built with Nuxt 3, Vue 3, Vuetify 3, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Pinia, and more. Its goal is to showcase my projects, skills, and experience as a full-stack developer.

üì¶ Scripts
Use these npm scripts to develop, build, generate, and maintain the site:

Script Description
npm run dev Launches the Nuxt development server with hot-reload (local preview at http://localhost:3000).
npm run build Compiles a production-ready build for server-side rendering or static generation.
npm run generate Generates fully static HTML files (ideal for GitHub Pages or any static-hosting environment).
npm run preview Starts a local preview of your built (or generated) site to validate production output.
npm run postinstall Automatically runs nuxt prepare after installing dependencies, ensuring Nuxt‚Äôs type metadata is up to date.
npm run lint Runs ESLint on all .js, .ts, and .vue files to catch syntax errors, best-practice violations, and style issues.
npm run format Runs Prettier to format JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue, JSON, CSS, and other supported files.
